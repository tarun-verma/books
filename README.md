List of academic texts I'm either reading or planning on doing so.

For non-academic stuff, check out my [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977935-tarun-verma).
### Reading
- [*Reverse Engineering for Beginners*](http://beginners.re/), D. Yurichev (started 06/01/2016): I'm doing an independent study at college on reverse engineering. This book's quite useful, but a bit verbose at times.
- [*Reverse Engineering Code with IDA Pro*](http://www.amazon.com/Reverse-Engineering-Code-IDA-Pro/dp/159749237X), D. Kaminsky (started 02/02/2016): More like a guide to [IDA](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/).
- [*Classic Shell Scripting*](http://www.amazon.com/Classic-Shell-Scripting-Arnold-Robbins/dp/0596005954), Robbin & Beebe (started 17/01/2016): I still don't know shell scripting.
- [*Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy*](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Mathematical-Philosophy-Bertrand-Russell/dp/1420938401), B. Russell: Mathematical philosophy is a side interest.

### To Read
- [*Linear Algebra Done Wrong*](https://www.math.brown.edu/~treil/papers/LADW/LADW.html), S. Treil: Didn't pay much attention to Linear Algebra classes in school. Have been regretting my existence ever since.
- [*Safe C++*](http://www.amazon.com/Safe-How-avoid-common-mistakes-ebook/dp/B00885RVNS), V. Kushnir
- [*Dragon Book*](http://www.amazon.com/Safe-How-avoid-common-mistakes-ebook/dp/B00885RVNS), J. Ullman, A. Aho, M. S. Lam, R. Sethi
- [*Real World Haskell*](http://www.amazon.com/Real-World-Haskell-Bryan-OSullivan/dp/0596514980), B. O'Sullivan, J. Goerzen & D. Stewart: Finished the Delft course on edX, but didn't take much from it. This book might help.
